# Web-Scraping-Challenge
Web Scraping and Mongo hw

Here is my submission for the Web-Scraping hw

The jupyter notebook used was the Mission_to_Mars__ file

    here you will find most-to-all of the pandas python work to create/scrape the data images and tables

in the scrape_mars.py I just fully finished off the dictionary to be used for calling into the index.html

in the screenshot folder is a screenshot of the webpage after scraping.

This hw was nice to retrieve the data and scrape the sites and put it altogether.
